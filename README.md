# Arduino library for MERG LCB running over CAN bus

Together with the other MLCB libraries, it provides everything required to implement a FLiM MLCB module that can be configured using FCU or JMRI.

This library contains an abstract base class that must be implemented by a concrete subclass, depending on the processor and CAN controller to be used, e.g. MLCB2515, MLCBESP32, etc.
